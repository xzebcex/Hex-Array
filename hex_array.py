# Hex Array

# Set up the constants:
# (!) Try changing these values to other numbers:
X_REPEAT = 20  # How many times to tessellate horizontally.
Y_REPEAT = 10  # How many times to tessellate vertically.


for y in range(Y_REPEAT):
    # Display the top half of the hexagon:

    print()

    # Display the bottom half of the hexagon:
    for x in range(X_REPEAT):
        print(r'\_/ ', end='')
